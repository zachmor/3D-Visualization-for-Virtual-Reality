# 3D Visualizations for Virtual Reality

This course was led by [David Laidlaw](https://cs.brown.edu/~dhl/). Students devised their own projects. They shared their discoveries in student-led class discussions and eventually brought their work into the [YURT](https://www.brown.edu/academics/early-cultures/resources-brown/yurt).
